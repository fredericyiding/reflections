----------------------
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize the repository, it creates a .git hidden file. This file will be used by Git later to do the version control. 

git init 
is used to initialize the repository. Only after the initialization can we track changes and do every other jobs related to git version control (e.g., git log, git status, etc).


----------------------
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives us more flexibility and control by using the STAGING AREA instead of the WORKING DIRECTORY to create the commit. We can specify exactly WHAT CHANGES TO BE COMMITTED.
