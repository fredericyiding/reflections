What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize the repository, it creates a .git hidden file. This file will be used by Git later to do the version control. 

git init 
is used to initialize the repository. Only after the initialization can we track changes and do every other jobs related to git version control (e.g., git log, git status, etc).
